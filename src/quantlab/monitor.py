"""Phase 6 monitoring: is the live experiment intact, and does live IC
match backtest IC?

The live logs in ``results/live/`` are append-only records (committed by CI
after each cycle). This module turns them into the three numbers that matter:

- **continuity** -- which expected trading days have no logged cycle. A hole
  in the record must be caught within days and explained in the write-up,
  not discovered when the experiment ends.
- **live IC** -- per-cycle Spearman rank correlation between logged
  predictions and the realized residualized label, computed with the same
  label machinery as the backtest (``features.build_labels``) so the
  live-vs-backtest comparison is apples-to-apples. This is the project's
  ultimate out-of-sample test.
- **realized book P&L** -- mark-to-market of the logged weights from public
  prices: an independent cross-check on the broker's equity curve, not a
  performance claim (costs and fills live at the broker).

Monitoring is read-only by design: nothing here feeds back into the
strategy, so it cannot become a leak vector.

Assumptions stated:
- A cycle's predictions mature ``horizon`` TRADING days after its as-of
  date; immature cycles are omitted from the IC series (the measurable-vs-
  logged count is itself a monitoring number).
- The label used for live IC residualizes against the equal-weight mean of
  the logged names (all index members at their as-of date), not the full
  PIT universe -- a close but not identical market proxy; stated in the
  report's limitations.
- NYSE holidays are not modeled (no new dependency): holidays show up as
  "missing" weekdays and are accepted by eye. The check exists to catch
  silent multi-day gaps, not to be a perfect calendar.
