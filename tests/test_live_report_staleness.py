"""Regression pin for the frozen-price-panel monitor bug (found 2026-08-06).

The nightly report ran six weeks on a June price cache ("latest"-keyed
parquet, restored by the CI cache every night), reporting "0 measurable
cycles" while ~17 had matured. The fix is a per-day snapshot cache dir plus
a staleness flag written into the report itself; this file pins the flag's
arithmetic so the alarm cannot silently rot.
